## Hi there 👋
My name is Irina. I've recently started my coding journey.
I've taken a couple of courses with Code First Girls in Python and SQL 
and completed an intense Northcoders BootCamp.

🍰 I’m currently working on AdventOfCode repo, getting into Christmas cheer

🍫 Studying hard for my first AWS certification exam

🍪 I’m happy to collaborate on any DE projects, especially  if they involve ETL and/or APIs

🧁 Fun fact - I use sweet emoji because I used to be a pastry chef for 10 years
